This is a network utility tool that I developed to perform some network and security administrator tasks. Currently, this script can perform a good variety of tasks such as:
1) Port scans, including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK and comprehensive scan;
2) Banner grabbing;
3) DNS checks;
4) ifconfig;
5) ping.

Other features are being implemented. Future implementations may include WAP (web application firewall) detection, some automated tasks and others.
